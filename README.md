# Mathematics and Machine Learning Notes

This repository contains the notes taken while studying different materials in the field of mathematics and machine learning. The notes are written in Jupyter notebooks and are also available Google Colab. Mathematics are written in LaTeX.

In addition, I have included some of the resources I have used to study the topics in the resources folder.

## Section Details

### Mathematics

This section includes the notes for different topics in mathematics.

### Machine Learning

This section includes the notes for different topics in machine learning and deep learning. (This section is still underdeveloped and will be further updates as I study along)

### LaTex

This section includes the notes for LaTex. The notes are taken from *[Michelle Krummel](https://www.youtube.com/michellekrummel)*'s [online free LaTex course](https://youtu.be/ydOTMQC7np0). My notes are written in the Jupyter notebooks.
